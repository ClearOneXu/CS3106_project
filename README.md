# CS3106_project

This is experiment part of my final year project in NUS. My project is about Program synthesis using probabilistic programming. 

My experiment is derived from https://github.com/probprog/ppaml-summer-school-2016.

## Getting Started

Read [getting-started-guide.pdf](getting-started-guide.pdf) and follow the instructions.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
